    <p>Here's how to make yummy waffles taking inspiration from <a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/waffles-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RecipeTinEats</a>.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients you'll need:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>335g of Flour</li>
        <li>40g of Caster Sugar</li>
        <li>Pinch of Cooking Salt</li>
        <li>4 Teaspoons of Baking Soda</li>
        <li>330ml of Milk</li>
        <li>0.5 Teaspoons of Vanilla Essence</li>
        <li>4 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>150g of Unsalted Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Whisk dry</strong> – Place the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a large mixing bowl. Whisk to mix.</li>
        <li><strong>Whisk in wet</strong> – Add milk, eggs and vanilla. Whisk to combine. Add melted butter then whisk until lump free. The batter should be pourable but thick – slightly thinner than pancakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Recommend resting</strong> – Cover then refrigerate overnight, or for at least 2 hours. Softer insides, better flavour. Else, proceed immediately with cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat</strong> a waffle maker. A non stick one will not need oil, plus there is butter in the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooking</strong> – Use a ladle to pour batter in to just cover the iron. Don't get greedy – it will leak out the sides! Cook until golden and crisp – my good waffle iron takes 3 1/2 minutes, my Kmart one takes 6 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Serving</strong> – Transfer onto plates and serve as you go, with desired toppings. Or, put on a rack and keep warm in a preheated 70°C/150°F oven while you continue cooking!</li>
