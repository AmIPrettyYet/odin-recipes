    <p>Here's how to make yummy pikelets taking inspiration from <a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/pikelets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RecipeTinEats</a>.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients you'll need:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>185g plain flour</li>
        <li>2.5 Teaspoons of Baking Powder</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons of White Sugar</li>
        <li>Pinch of Salt</li>
        <li>1 Large Egg</li>
        <li>185ml of Milk</li>
        <li>0.5 Teaspoons of Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>2 Teaspoons of Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Whisk dry</strong> – Whisk the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar in a bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Add wet</strong> – Make a well in the centre. Add the egg, milk and vanilla, then whisk until it's almost lump free. The batter should be the consistency like thick honey – looser than tomato sauce, thicker than maple syrup.</li>
        <li><strong>Melt</strong> 1 tsp butter in a non-stick pan over medium high heat (or medium, for strong stoves). Then most of the butter off with a paper towel so there are no visible drops of bubbles of butter.</li>
        <li><strong>Drop ~2 tbsp batter</strong> into the pan and coax into 7.5cm/3" rounds. An ice cream scoop with lever will be your friend here. I cook 4 at a time.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook</strong> until bubbles appear on the surface and once 4 or more of these bubbles pop (1 1/2 minutes), this means they are ready to flip. Flip with confidence! Then cook the other side for 1 minute or until golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep cooking</strong> – Remove onto a plate. Cook the next batch (no need to add extra butter until 3rd batch).</li>
        <li><strong>Serve</strong> warm with jam and cream, or butter!</li>
    </ol>
